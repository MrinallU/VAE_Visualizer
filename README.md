# VAE Visualization Tool

This project visualizes the output of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using sliders to manipulate the latent space. It includes a visualizer to show generated images and the differences between them.

## Features

- **VAE Architecture:** Convolutional layers for encoding and decoding images.
- **Visualization:** Interactive sliders to manipulate the latent space and observe changes in the generated images.
- **Heatmap:** Display of cosine similarity heatmap for the latent vectors.
- **Comparison:** Comparison of generated images using mean squared error and cosine similarity.
